# Thermal endpoint-selector efficiency — September 27

The 400-day trainer remains shadow-only. A representative isolated two-fit
`cProfile` run spent 2.208 seconds selecting multihorizon endpoints and
11.614 seconds in the numerical objective/gradient. Endpoint selection
rescanned up to 288 confidence values for every eligible origin. It now uses
a monotonic sliding minimum over each horizon's next-row window, preserving
the same endpoint, forcing prefix and exact minimum confidence.

The same deterministic two-fit profile after the change spent 1.477 seconds
in endpoint selection (about 33% less for that substep); overall profiled
time changed from 15.072 to 14.680 seconds, too small and noisy to predict
the full natural-run benefit. The optimizer remains the dominant CPU cost.
All 57 dynamics tests and 690 thermal Python tests passed, including a new
naive-prefix parity test across all five horizons and an invalid interior row.
No training objective, model coefficient bound, acceptance gate, published
trajectory or control policy was changed.

The two thermal services were idle and their timers were stopped for the
attended installation. A full-manifest preflight found intentional source-only
v5 drift in `thermal_intel.py`, `artifacts.py` and `evaluation.py`; the full
installer was not run. Only the compatible `dynamics.py` was installed with
the existing receipt-bound, atomic transaction helper using a one-entry
manifest. Its prior SHA-256 was
`b94832dcdf0739d24ec5b6bf43e177bdf17308993c2fb8c3b9f49cea994421b2`;
installed and source SHA-256 now both equal
`82117c224b9fcfb6819a6b3dfa5fc14d60690e131813561b48b979dc8d7947b9`.
The verified rollback receipt is private at
`/home/sat/.local/state/thermal-intel/deploy-receipts/selector-one-20260927-wb3fHq/files/`.
The unused full-manifest preflight snapshot was deleted after inspecting its
exact 516 KiB contents. Both timers were restarted and passed the
`timers-enabled` state check. The next natural shadow publication and the
September 28 06:50 trainer are the runtime gates. Do not infer shadow-exit
readiness or swap relief from this isolated CPU profile.

## Second measured numerical-loop optimization

The same two-fit profile showed roughly 3.15 million NumPy `all()` reductions
in the rollout's per-step finite checks. Replacing only the two-element state
array reduction with two scalar `math.isfinite` checks left the sensitivity
array check, state transition arithmetic, objective, gradient and optimizer
unchanged. The representative profiled run fell from 14.680 to 13.173 seconds;
this is an isolated timing, not a measured 400-day trainer speedup. A new
overflow regression confirms a nonfinite state still refuses the rollout.
All 691 thermal Python tests passed.

Both services were idle and both timers briefly stopped for a second exact
one-file transaction. The expected installed preimage was
`82117c224b9fcfb6819a6b3dfa5fc14d60690e131813561b48b979dc8d7947b9`;
the installed/source SHA-256 is now
`59ae03f91afc4e0d51e7c24cdd8e2f3a7f477beb0052ce1201e67260e4b8ee7a`.
The private rollback receipt is
`/home/sat/.local/state/thermal-intel/deploy-receipts/finite-one-20260927-5EFjQC/files/`.
The installed module imports successfully and both timers again pass
`timers-enabled`. The next natural shadow publication and September 28 trainer
remain the runtime gates; no shadow-exit claim follows from this optimization.

The natural September 27 16:15 MDT shadow service subsequently exited zero
with 1.048 seconds CPU time. Live `Thermal_Model_JSON` advanced to a
22:15:50.065912Z publication with `status=shadow`, low confidence, no
candidate schedule and the accepted artifact's existing code revision.
`Thermal_Advisory` remained `none|No thermal action needed`. This closes the
post-install publisher/import compatibility check only. The optimized
endpoint selection and rollout objective are exercised by tomorrow's 06:50
training run, whose timing and artifact gates remain unverified.

## Third measured source-only allocation reduction

A fresh isolated 30-day synthetic fit profile spent 6.035 of 7.234 seconds in
61 multihorizon objective/gradient evaluations, with 914,808 small-array
finite reductions and repeated two-by-two Jacobian and direct-gradient
allocations. Reusing those two scratch arrays within each endpoint and updating
the two-element state in place reduced that same profiled fit to 6.149 seconds
overall and 4.947 seconds in the objective (one run each; not a whole-trainer
claim). The objective and gradient matched the prior committed implementation
bit-for-bit on the same 30-day evidence, and all 691 thermal Python tests
passed. No model equation, coefficient bound, scoring gate, or control policy
changed. The installed runtime still has the prior `dynamics.py` hash
`59ae03f91afc4e0d51e7c24cdd8e2f3a7f477beb0052ce1201e67260e4b8ee7a`
at the initial source-only checkpoint. At 17:29 MDT, both services were idle
and their enabled timers were briefly stopped for an exact one-file transaction.
The private receipt at
`/home/sat/.local/state/thermal-intel/deploy-receipts/array-one-20260927-3oieQT/files/`
pins that prior hash and the source hash
`2c8012d5c750a25f72b9cda5a0e5e241958ad7f3ee8334c96385e3fb2a864b0f`.
The guarded installer changed only installed `thermal_model/dynamics.py`;
receipt verification and source/runtime SHA equality passed. Both timers were
restarted and passed `timers-enabled`. The installed module imported and an
isolated 30-day synthetic fit completed with objective decreasing from
0.00017959468716428502 to 0.0001582665101962629. No production model artifact
or control was changed. The September 28 natural trainer remains the
whole-run timing and accepted-artifact gate.
