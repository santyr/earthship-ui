# Verification evidence

Audit base: `65ee7e95d58e6a6101700da3eccea67c9fea0ec7`. Initial remote CI [39434796248](https://github.com/santyr/earthship-ui/actions/runs/39434796248) failed OpenHAB shards 0/1; separate [thermal delivery](https://github.com/santyr/earthship-ui/actions/runs/39434796413) passed. Remote main and no open PRs verified at start. Local complete baseline not yet established.

Environments: host Node v24.13.0 / npm 11.17.0 (general CI requires Node 22); Python 3.12.3; Docker 29.8.0. Fresh `/tmp/earthship-audit-20261020-venv` uses requirements-test.txt. Companion source extracted at exact `24d2e8984810cb596fe9792768510a356786f709` into `.ci/solar-pv` (the live companion checkout differs and is untouched). `npm ci` ran only in isolated checkout. WeatherNext and sensor environments remain separate.

Normal bwrap command startup failed with `Failed RTM_NEWADDR: Operation not permitted`; approved escalated commands are used. Resource admission remains mandatory for substantial workloads. Logs stay outside public source; curated command/results will be recorded here. Counts from focused/repeated runs are not added as distinct tests.

## Geometry baseline isolation

The unlaunched synthetic-fixture reproduction finished exit 1: exactly the six handoff failures, 30 passed, 1.41s (`/tmp/earthship-audit-six-red.log`). Under the legitimate shared production-compatible launcher, 35 passed and a separate source-permission mismatch failed: native provenance correctly refused group-writable files from worktree creation. Tracked files in this disposable checkout alone were tightened with `mode & ~022`, matching CI provenance; no production permissions were changed.

The same three fixture files plus `openhab/scripts/test_household_cycle_resources.py` finished exit 0: **101 passed in 3.41s** (`/tmp/earthship-audit-geometry-green.log`). Only synthetic fixtures inject publication preflight; real cap/swap/IO/nice/headroom/thread rejection tests remain unchanged. Full shards remain pending.
